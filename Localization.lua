Data is collected for every item on the auction house, an exception being for specific data of randomly-enchanted armor and weapons.\n\nThis data includes:\n* the 2-day mean price for items on your realm's auction house\n* the 14-day mean price for items on your realm's auction house\n* the 14-day standard deviation of prices for items on your realm's auction house\n* the global median price for items\n* the global mean price for items\n* the global standard deviation of prices for items\n* the number of days since items were last seen on your realm's auction house\n* the age of the data being used by the addon"

AuctioneerLocalizations.enUS["BBG_Help_Answer2"] = "Auc-Stat-BootyBayGazette allows Auctioneer to use the market data from Booty Bay Gazette. It can then estimate the price of items either using raw information from Booty Bay Gazette, or by using a combination of data sources. These prices are displayable in an item's tooltip.\n\nThe data can also be used in a number of Auctioneer's other modules, such as in Auctioneer's Appraiser tab, Auctioneer's Search > Resale tab, etc."
AuctioneerLocalizations.enUS["BBG_Help_Question3"] = "Which of these settings should I select for best results?"
AuctioneerLocalizations.enUS["BBG_Help_Answer3"] = "Including any of the prices listed below in price evaluation will cause Auctioneer to take the lowest of any prices selected. Essentially, the more of the four listed prices that are selected, the more conservative the price estimate will be.\n\nThe 2-day price will be more in line with what your realm's auction house currently has items priced at. This generally provides a very poor price estimate, and should only be selected if you are looking for the most conservative estimate possible. The 14-day price is often useful if you want to evalute prices based on their local pricing trends; that is, their \"moving\" price. The global median price is generally the best method of determining what the current price of an item should be on any given realm's auction house. While selecting the global mean price by itself is a bad idea in general due to bias from outlying prices, selecting the global mean price in addition to the global median price may yield a slightly more conservative estimate for some items.\n\nEnabling a local or global price volatility threshold is not recommended except when it is necessary to garuntee that the prices for items will not likely change over a long period of time; most relevant for bulk purchases of cheap, commonly sold items. The importance of whether or not the price of an item is volatile either locally or globally varies greatly from item to item."

AuctioneerLocalizations.enUS["BBG_Help_Answer4"] = "If you are looking to automate selling, you may want to set Appraiser's default pricing model to \"Stats: Booty Bay Gazette,\" enable price matching, and use Auctioneer's Undercut module to automatically undercut within a certain percentage of a given price.\n\nIf you are looking to automate buying, Auctioneer's Search > Resale tab could be used with \"Booty Bay Gazette Price\" set as the Price Valuation Method to determine if a given item is a good buy.\n\nPlease keep in mind that use cases vary greatly from person to person. Do not come crying to me when you lose 50k speculating on a [17 Pound Catfish] because you \"had a good feeling about it.\""
